# TASK-2 : Data Visualization and Storytelling
## Summary: 
Creating a Dashboard and Telling a Story with Data using Power BI

### I used **Power BI** to create a dashboard that helps people understand data easily. First, I upload dataset, After that, I built charts, graphs, and other visuals to show important information clearly.
### And narrate it separately to understand better.I focused on Business insights,not just visual and I upload the visual report as pdf in this repositary.

The goal was not just to show numbers, but to tell a story with the data—like showing what’s working, what’s not, and where things are going. The dashboard lets users click around and explore the data on their own. In the end, it helped others see the bigger picture and make better decisions based on the data.
